# CodSoft Internship Projects

Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects developed during my internship at CodSoft. Here, you will find three distinct projects that showcase my skills and learning journey:

1. Calculator: A simple yet robust calculator application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.
2. Stone Paper Scissor Game: An interactive and fun implementation of the classic game, allowing users to play against the computer.
3. To-Do List: A practical and user-friendly to-do list application to help manage and track daily tasks efficiently.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback. Thank you for visiting!
